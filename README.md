# Project Collection

This collection contains several folders, each representing a unique project or sketch, primarily focused on creative coding and algorithm visualization using p5.js. Here's a brief overview of each directory:

## a_star

Contains HTML and JavaScript files for visualizing the A\* pathfinding algorithm.

## a_star_pt2

A continuation of the A\* pathfinding visualization with additional features or variations.

## circles-p5

A p5.js sketch that involves circles, with the necessary HTML and JavaScript files.

## disco_grid

Includes files for a grid-based visual effect, presumably a dynamic, interactive grid pattern.

## fractal_tree

This directory has files for visualizing fractal trees, a common example in recursive algorithm visualization.

## gift_wrapping

Contains a visualization related to the gift wrapping algorithm, potentially for demonstrating the convex hull problem.

## grid

Files for creating and manipulating a grid structure, possibly for various grid-based algorithms or visualizations.

## libraries

Holds the p5.js library file, which is a key component for all the sketches and visualizations in this collection.

## maze_generator

Contains a maze generation algorithm visualization, with HTML and JavaScript files.

## maze_generator_pt2

An extension or variation of the maze generator project found in the previous directory.

## quad_tree

Includes files related to visualizing a quadtree data structure, with a focus on particles and spatial partitioning.

## test

A simple directory set up for testing or demonstration purposes, with basic HTML and JavaScript files.

Each directory is a self-contained project that can be opened and run in a web browser, assuming p5.js is properly linked (either locally or via CDN). These projects are ideal for learning about various algorithms and creative coding techniques.
